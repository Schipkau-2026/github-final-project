# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a basic Simple Interest Calculator implemented in Python.

## Formula

Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

    SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest (per year)
- T = Time (in years)

## Features

- Takes principal, rate, and time as input
- Calculates simple interest
- Displays the final result clearly

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Run the script:

```
python simple_interest.py
```

## Example

Input:
Principal: 1000  
Rate: 5  
Time: 2  

Output:
Simple Interest = 100.0
